The **goal** is to engage a learner quickly by asking them to get active in buiding a circuit and getting something working quickly. Knowledge and skills will be given as the learner progresses.

####Setting Up The PiBot Learning Environment

The course is to be engaged with using:
- a working raspberry pi set up 
- the pibot development kit (breadboard, components etc)
- the ardunio IDE set up and working on the Raspberry Pi.
- a seperate interface to engage with the learning content. 

###### Working Raspberry Pi 
The Raspberry Pi should be built with a keyboard, mouse and monitor connected. The PiBot IO board should be attached and screwed into position on the Raspberry Pi.  The system should either be powered from an external power source through the Raspberry Pi's 5V micro USB power input or through the PiBot IO board and an Integrated PiHero Power Module. 

###### Development Kit
The PiBots breadboard and components should be laid out nearby and ready for use. 

###### Software Environment
This course uses a customised Arduino IDE that has been pre-configured and setup for use with the PiBot IO board. This is where code is inputted and sent to the microcontroller.   (Poss This is either available on an SD card provided with your PiBot kit or can be downloaded and istalled from source at the [PiBot Github repo - to be incldued later](To be included later).

###### Seperate Inteface for Learning Content
Unless the learners are using very big or multi-monitor displays it makes sense to prepare all the learning content for delivery through a web browser.  This can then be viewed and engaged with on a separate device whether that is a laptop, or tablet computer. An Ipad or android tablet could be considered as an ideal device for this. 


###Presentation of Content
Robotics in multi-disciplined as are the skills that people increasingly value in work. For example to be a good architect communication and management skills may be just a important as drawing or technical knowledge. Increasingly its valuable to learn technology *at the same time* as other skills. This course intends to give great value by facilitating and inspiring learning in several areas at the same time.  Our task is to find the best way to present, integrate, or blend these different areas of learning together.  

Whilst the delivery interface is not yet complete we can already consider make distinctions between different areas of learning. This, for example, could be then be presented on diffferent tabs. e.g.:
- **Physical Computing**. Laying out and connection of physical components 
- **Coding**. Using the arduino IDE to learn C and programming.
- **Electronics** Learn about the electronics at play in the lesson.
- **IT & Robotics** Learn key theory and information technology aspects to the lesson. 

When this course is delivered teachers/educators can choose what they would like to include as well as being able to customise the  the content.  (e.g. they could remove the electronics tab if they did not want to include this).
