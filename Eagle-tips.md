Having just learnt eagle I wanted a place to gather the tips and tricks I'm discovering.

###Making Parts 

#####Process
- Make symbol
- Make Package 
- Make Device 

Quickest way is often to edit existing elements rather that builing from scratch.  Fist I gather all the devices that I want to copy from in a new project library. Then I proceed to edit and rename things.


**Copying an element and nenaming in using command on the command line.**
```
copy existing.pac@yourlibname new.pac
```
*substitue package , symbol, or device names as appropriate. 

**Renaming elements using the commandcommand line**
*first open your library.
On the command line type: 
```
RENAME old.pac new.pac
```
The above is renaming a package (**xxx.pac**) though you can do the same for **.dev**(devices) and **.sym** (symbols)


##### Unanswered Questions.
Connector Pads.  Should they be laid as pads or made simply with rectangles in copper? I think pads may be best as not all boards will have a ground plain and its a good idea to connect these to ground.
