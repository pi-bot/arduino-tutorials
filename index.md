###Intro
This index outlines the full Pibot physical computing course. The aim is that its possible to run this course over a peroiod of 8 weeks. 

Each step to robot mastery will have a physical **doing** element (D), a **knowledge** elements (K) as well as a programming **skill** element (P). This way *physical computing* and *programming* are learned at the same time. 

- Physical Computing. Laying out and connection of physical components, learning how they work and how to control them.
- Coding. Using the arduino IDE to learn C and programming.
- IT & Robotics Learn key theory and information technology aspects to the lesson.


##0: Gaining Robot Powers. Bringing your Robot to Life

- 0 **Let there be light!** (D)Wire up an LED and make it blink! *(K)What is a MicroController?* How to run an existing program **(P)robots are controlled from text based programs. ** 
- 1 **Turn YOUR light on!** (D) Turn your own light on with your own program. *(K) What is programming? what is C?*  Introduction to the Arduino IDE. What is speaking robot? First steps in coding and speaking robot (aka learning programming in C)  **(P) Learn syntax, comments and error messages** 
- 2 **Controll your brightness** (D) Control Brightness. *(K)Introducing PWM, Analogue Electronics and binary bits.* Simple **(P) Variables **
- 3 **Change the world** Let the code control a servo.  *Learn first machine signals and actuators* simple **(P) Learn basic calculations A+B =C** 
- 4 **Super Powers** Do big things with little signals (aka Give your robot muscles). *Learn how to trigger from user input (e.g. a button)*  Introduce bottons.  **(P) If Else statement ** 



##2 Harmony. Co-ordinating and Extending Robot Powers 
**Not yet defined**   
- Incorporate the remaining hardware and sensors.( Stepper Motor, Neopixels & Ultrasound)
- Introduce Libraries and using code in a modular way.e.g.:
7. **Dancing** Creating code modules. *Use all your robot powers together*
- Learn the benefit of libraries and modular design. Turn previous lessons (leds, servos, DC motors) into libraries and make sketch that combines all of them into one. 
8. **Sensing the world** Measure and distance. *Filtering data to remove errors*
- Introduce the concept of feedback at a higher level using the serial interface. 
 Other Things to measuring Temperature -Potential Additions: -Measuring Humidity , -3 Axis accelerometers -IMU -Digital compass -GPS modules -Encoders


##3: Control is key. Change the world in the way that you want. 
**Not yet defined**  
--Clarify that microcontrollers are about measurement and control. Control systems are the heart of robotics.  Intoduce controll. Systems
9.**Let the robot take control** Make a program that keeps a given distance from an object.*Learn how to deal with fluctuations*
10.**Algorythims for Life** Learn PID control of the motors 

##4: Set your robot free! Automate and Remote Control
**Not yet defined** 
Covers how to create an API to the robot over serial.  This can then give all its control, command, measurement capabilities over to the Raspberry Pi.  The raspberry Pi can then use Python scripting.  This is a further demonstration of abstraction.
